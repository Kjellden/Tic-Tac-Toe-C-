# Tic-Tac-Toe-C-
# Overview

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that was made in C++. The goal of this program was to make a fun game that I could play with my friends and to help me better understand how c++ works with classes and includes (import in python). The game works by asking the names of the two players and the game will start when a winner is found it will give one point to the winner first player to three points that player will win.

# Future Work

* I would like to add an outside file to keep track of games so you could go back and look at the scores of games in the past and see what your win-rate is.
* I need to add a way to reset the board when it gets full and there is no winner.
* I would like to make a new class that will let the player pick what size board they want to play on.
